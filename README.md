ArduinoESP8266EasyConfig
========================

A wrapper for the ESP8266 module.

The library serves as a wrapper for the serial communication with an ESP8266 module. Furthermore it allows for easy wifi configuration as seen for the Fitbit Aria.

It is based on v0.20 of the AT command spec for the module and should not be considered stable in any way.
